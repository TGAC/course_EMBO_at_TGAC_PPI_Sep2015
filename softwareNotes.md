Notes on using VMs during the course

## Ubuntu VM

### List of shortcuts

On my (Aidan's) MacBook Pro, I get the list of shortcuts for the Ubuntu VM using leftclick-leftcommand

## NoMachine graphics

To edit how the NoMachine remote desktop shows the desktop from my Ubuntu VM, I go to the top right corner of the remote destop, the top of the page peels back, I can click on there, and specify e.g. "Full screen" and lots of other options.

## Updating training repo

Open a terminal, and move to the git repo directory (on the Desktop) - probably:

    cd Desktop
    cd course_EMBO_at_TGAC_PPI_Sep2015

Pull any changes

    git pull
