Apolipoprotein A-IV is a component of chylomicrons and high-density
lipoproteins. By isoelectric focusing, 2 isoforms, designated A-IV-1 and
A-IV-2, can be identified. Menzel et al. (1982) demonstrated another
variant form. Anderson and Anderson (1977) and Tracy et al. (1982)
described genetic polymorphism of an unidentified serum peptide with a
molecular weight of about 45,000. Schamaun et al. (1984) immunologically
identified this serum protein as apoA-IV. Karathanasis et al. (1986)
isolated and characterized the APOA4 gene. In contrast to APOA1 and
APOA3 genes, which contain 3 introns, the APOA4 gene contains only 2.
The similarities suggest, however, that the 3 closely linked genes were
derived from a common evolutionary ancestor, and that during evolution,
the APOA4 gene lost one of its introns. A polymorphic site in the second
intron and a polymorphic site 9 kb 3-prime to the APOA4 gene were found
to be polymorphic in Mediterranean and other European populations.
Elshourbagy et al. (1987) determined the complete nucleotide sequence of
the APOA4 gene and, contrary to the findings described above, reported
that the gene contains 3 exons of 162, 127, and 1180 nucleotides
separated by 2 introns of 357 and 777 nucleotides. They stated that the
human APOA4 gene lacks an intron in the area encoding the 5-prime
untranslated region of its mRNA, which distinguishes it from all the
other human apolipoprotein genes whose sequences are known. Kamboh and
Ferrell (1987) determined the frequency of polymorphism at the APOA4
locus by a simple and rapid 1-dimensional isoelectric-focusing technique
followed by immunoblotting. In an Icelandic population, Menzel et al.
(1990) found a higher frequency of the APOA4*2 allele (0.117 vs 0.077)
than in Tyroleans (Menzel et al., 1988). In both populations the alleles
at the APOA4 locus had significant effects on plasma high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In the Icelandic
population, the average effect of the APO4*2 allele was to raise
cholesterol by 4.9 mg/dl and to lower triglyceride levels by 19.4 mg/dl.
Menzel et al. (1990) estimated that the genetic variability at the APOA4
locus accounted for 3.1% of the total variability of HDL cholesterol and
for 2.8% of the total variability of triglycerides in the Icelandic
population. Genetically determined polymorphism of apoA-IV has been
reported in dogs, horses, and baboons, in addition to humans. Data on
gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by Roychoudhury and
Nei (1988).

In a Norwegian family with a mutant APOA1 gene and polymorphism of
APOA4, Schamaun et al. (1984) found close linkage of the APOA1 and APOA4
loci; for the sexes combined, the peak lod score was 3.01 at a
recombination fraction of 0.00. Rogne et al. (1986) raised the lod score
to 6.32 by using 2 DNA polymorphisms of an APOA1 probe to study families
informative for apoA-IV protein variants. Karathanasis (1985) showed
that the APOA4 gene is located 12 kb 3-prime to the APOA1 gene.

Duverger et al. (1996) expressed the human APOA4 gene in the livers of
mice deficient in apoE (107741). They found that apoA-4 levels did not
affect the levels of HDL cholesterol in these mice. However, transgenic
mice had a significant reduction in the size of atherosclerotic lesions.
Duverger et al. (1996) suggested that apoA-IV protects against
atherosclerosis by a mechanism that does not involve an increase in HDL
cholesterol concentration. They stated that their data support other
evidence that suggests that apoA-IV may participate in reverse
cholesterol transport (from tissues to the liver for elimination).

Cohen et al. (1997) produced transgenic mice with inserts of several
copies of murine apoA-IV gene. They found 3-fold increases in plasma
apoA-IV levels in mice fed a chow diet and 6-fold increases in those fed
an atherogenic diet. Plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol, and free fatty acids were increased, while unesterified
cholesterol was decreased, in the atherogenic diet group. Transgenic
mice exhibited 70% fewer aortic lesions than controls. HDL-sized
lipoproteins from mice fed the atherogenic diet promoted greater
cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded human monocytes than
controls, and plasma from these mice showed raised cholesterol
esterification rates. Cohen et al. (1997) suggested that apoA-IV levels
may influence metabolism of HDL and its effects on atherogenesis.

APOLIPOPROTEIN A-IV POLYMORPHISM, APOA4*1/APOA4*2
APOA4, GLN360HIS

Lohse et al. (1990) demonstrated that the genetic polymorphism of plasma
apolipoprotein A-IV, detected by isoelectric focusing followed by
immunoblotting, results from a single nucleotide change. Specifically,
the difference between APOA4*1 and APOA4*2 is a G-to-T substitution
leading to a conversion of glutamine-360 to histidine in the mature
protein. The allelic change is predicted to cause the loss of 2
restriction enzyme sites in the formation of a new restriction site for
a third enzyme. In Caucasian populations, the APOA4*1 and APOA4*2
alleles have a frequency of about 0.9 and 0.08, respectively; 3 rare
alleles, APOA4*0 (107690.0002), APOA4*3 (107690.0003), and APOA4*4, have
been described. In a study of various polymorphisms of APOA4, von
Eckardstein et al. (1992) could not confirm the previously reported
association of elevated HDL cholesterol concentrations with the his360
allele; from other associations, the authors concluded that the APOA4
gene locus has an important role in the metabolism of apolipoprotein B
and, to a lesser extent, apolipoprotein A-I-containing lipoproteins.

APOLIPOPROTEIN A-IV RARE VARIANT, APOA4*0
APOA4, 12-BP INS, GLU-GLN-GLN-GLN INS, CODONS 361-362 

Lohse et al. (1990) described the molecular basis of the rare variant
APOA4*0: an insertion of 12 nucleotides in the carboxyl-terminal region,
which is highly conserved among human, rat, and mouse A-IV
apolipoproteins. This in-frame insertion of 4 amino acids,
glu-gln-gln-gln, between residues 361 and 362 of the mature protein,
produces the 1-charge unit, more acidic APOA4*0 isoprotein (pI = 4.92).

.0003
APOLIPOPROTEIN A-IV RARE VARIANT, APOA4*3
APOA4, GLU230LYS

Lohse et al. (1990) identified a single G-to-A substitution that
converted the glutamic acid (GAG) at position 230 of the mature apoA-IV
protein to lysine (AAG). The change added 2 positive charge units to the
apoA-IV-1 isoprotein (pI = 4.97) to give the more basic APOA4*3
isoprotein (pI, 5.08).

.0004
APOLIPOPROTEIN A-IV RARE VARIANT, APOA4*5
APOA4, 12-BP INS, GLU-GLN-GLN-GLN INS

Kamboh et al. (1992) described the same in-frame insertion of 12
nucleotides (coding for the 4 amino acids glu-gln-gln-gln) near the
carboxy-terminal region of the mature protein as Lohse et al. (1990)
(see 107690.0002). This study also revealed a polymorphism (G to T,
codon 316, third position) that did not result in an amino acid
substitution. Kamboh et al. (1992) noted that finding the exact position
of the 12 inserted bases was difficult because the sequences of 2 of the
5 repeat units in the APOA4*5 allele are identical. Possible sites of
insertion are between codons 357 and 358, or between codons 361 and 362.
Using data obtained from 308 subjects, they estimated the frequency of
the APOA4*5 allele in African Americans to be 3.2%.
