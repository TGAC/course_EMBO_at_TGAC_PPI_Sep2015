# Unseminars and NUB

An unseminar is a shorter version of an
[unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference unconference). We have
been  running
[bioinformatics unseminars in Heidelberg](http://www.hub-hub.de/wiki/index.php?title=HUB:About) for several years, and this time are running one here in Norwich
at TGAC, linked to the EMBO Practical Course we're running here.

All trainers and trainees from the course are invited to the unseminar; part of
the reason for running this event, is to give locals who are not on the course,
but are interested in open data-related issues a chance to discuss these issues,
and to meet up with trainers and trainees from this course. It's not at all
limited just to bioinformaticians - we welcome bench scientists,
bioinformaticians, or non-researchers interested in these topics or just
generally in organising alternative-format events and/or science communications.

This is the second time Holger, Aidan, and Matt put on an unseminar in Norwich -
the [previous one](http://www.hub-hub.de/wiki/index.php?title=NUB1) was March 2015, and was linked with the
[User Experience Design workshop](http://www.tgac.ac.uk/361_Division/training-programme/courses-workshops/tgac-events/ux-workshop/)
organised by TGAC that we were involved in.
